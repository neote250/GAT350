## Overview

This repository demonstrates two complementary rendering techniques:

- The **Software Renderer** focuses on real-time, rasterization-based rendering on the CPU.
- The **Ray Tracing Engine** emphasizes photorealism, simulating light and shadow behavior with high fidelity.

Both projects are designed to provide educational value and serve as a foundation for building more complex rendering systems.

## Technical Details

### Software Renderer Technical Details

#### Gouraud Shading
Gouraud shading interpolates vertex colors across a polygonâ€™s surface:
1. Vertex normals are calculated or pre-defined.
2. Lighting calculations are applied per vertex using the **Phong Reflection Model**.
3. Color values are linearly interpolated across the polygon.

#### Phong Shading
Phong shading performs per-pixel lighting for more accurate results:
1. Vertex normals are interpolated across the polygon.
2. At each pixel, the interpolated normal is used in the **Phong Reflection Model** for lighting.
3. Results in smoother highlights and better lighting transitions.

#### Shader Emulation
- **Vertex Shader:** Simulates transformations and lighting calculations for vertices.
- **Fragment Shader:** Applies per-pixel operations like interpolation and lighting.

### Ray Tracing Engine Technical Details

#### Material Types
- **Diffuse:** Lambertian reflection for matte surfaces. 
  - Light scatters uniformly in all directions.
- **Metals:** Reflective surfaces modeled using Fresnel equations. 
  - Includes adjustable roughness for blurred reflections.
- **Dielectrics:** Transparent materials with refraction (e.g., glass, water).
  - Supports total internal reflection and customizable indices of refraction.
- **Procedural Materials:** Uses mathematical functions to generate textures like stripes, noise, or gradients.

#### Anti-Aliasing
To reduce jagged edges, the ray tracer uses **Supersampling**:
1. Multiple rays are cast per pixel with jittered offsets.
2. Color values are averaged to produce a smoother result.
3. Configurable sampling rate (e.g., 4x, 16x) for performance trade-offs.
